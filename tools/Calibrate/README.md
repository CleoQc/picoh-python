# Calibration Tool - Beta. 

Just the lip for now, other motors to follow. 

Right click and save as: [EyeShapeDesigner.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohbot/picoh-python/master/tools/Calibrate/calibrate-beta.py)  in your current working directory then run in IDLE or a python editor of your choice. 

The Calibration will read and write motor defitions from the ```MotorDefinitionsPicoh.omd``` file found within the picohData/ in your working directory.
