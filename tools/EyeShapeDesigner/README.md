# Eye Shape Designer. (Currently only optimised for macOS other platforms will be fixed soon) 

Copy the code from [EyeShapeDesigner.py](https://github.com/ohbot/picoh-python/blob/master/tools/EyeShapeDesigner/EyeShapeDesigner.py) paste it in IDLE or a python editor of your choice and run. 

The Eye Shape Designer will read and write from the Ohbot.obe file found within the picohData/ in your working directory.
