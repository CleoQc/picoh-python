# Eye Shape Designer. (Currently only optimised for macOS other platforms will be fixed soon) 

Copy the code from [EyeShapeDesigner.py](https://github.com/ohbot/picoh-python/blob/master/tools/EyeShapeDesigner/EyeShapeDesigner.py) and paste into a new window in IDLE then run.

The eyeshape designer will read and write from the Ohbot.obe file found within the picohData/ in your working directory.
