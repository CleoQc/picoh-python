# Eye Shape Designer. 

(Currently only optimised for macOS other platforms will be fixed soon) 

Right click and save as: [EyeShapeDesigner.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohbot/picoh-python/master/tools/EyeShapeDesigner/EyeShapeDesigner.py) and run in IDLE or a python editor of your choice. 

The Eye Shape Designer will read and write eyeshapes from the Ohbot.obe file found within the picohData/ in your working directory.
