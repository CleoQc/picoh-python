# Speech Databse.

(Currently only optimised for macOS other platforms will be fixed soon) 

Copy the code from [SpeechDatabse.py](https://github.com/ohbot/picoh-python/blob/master/tools/SpeechDatabase/SpeechDatabase.py) and paste into a new window in IDLE then run.

The speech database program will read and write from PicohSpeech.csv found within the picohData/ in your working directory.
