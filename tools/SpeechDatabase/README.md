# Speech Databse.

(Currently only optimised for macOS other platforms will be fixed soon) 

Right click and save file as: [SpeechDatabse.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohbot/picoh-python/master/tools/SpeechDatabase/SpeechDatabase.py) then run it in IDLE or a Python editor of your choice. 

The speech database program will read and write from PicohSpeech.csv found within the picohData/ in your working directory.
